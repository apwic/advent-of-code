## Day 24: Crossed Wires

### Part 1

This puzzle are using logic gate operation which is AND, OR, and XOR. The thing
to keep in mind is that the value that's supposed to be processed at the logic
gate might not be present yet. So, using queue to process which ever gate that
can be processed first will work. Quite straight forward as for the logic in
this puzzle.
